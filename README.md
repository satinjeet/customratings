Custom Rating System

Just a little plugin to add a custom rating system .. away with the stars and dropdowns and other old system :).


<h2>Using Rating Plugin</h2>

It is really very simple. Just add the following to the code:
<pre>
"
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="{path_to_js}/src/rating.min.js"></script>

<div class="ratings">
    <div class="inner">
    </div>
</div>
"

</pre>


and tada.... you are done !!
